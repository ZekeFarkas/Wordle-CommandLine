# Wordle-CommandLine
Command line version of Wordle game, based on https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/

- Runs from the wordle.py file.
- words.csv is a list of ~5800 5 letter words, used to get the word list for the game


### Issues:
- Uses termcolor to have colored text for python, but does not work in all python shells
  -> Will not work in IDLE
  -> Should work in standard terminal (tested on MacOS)
